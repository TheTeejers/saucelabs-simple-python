Very simple tests for Sauce Labs that don't require huge frameworks

# Appium usage
These don't require an Appium server installed. There are two ways to use Appium that I've found.

1 - You can add the Appium library to your execution so that it can be imported
2 - Install the [Appium-Python-Client](https://pypi.org/project/Appium-Python-Client/) and not have to worry about it.
    Installation can be done with `pip install Appium-Python-Client` in your execution directory
