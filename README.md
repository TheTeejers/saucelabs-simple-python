# Appium usage
These don't require an Appium server installed. There are two ways to use Appium that I've found.

* You can add the Appium library to your execution so that it can be imported.
* Install the [Appium-Python-Client](https://pypi.org/project/Appium-Python-Client/) and not have to worry about it.
  *  Installation can be done with `pip install Appium-Python-Client` in your execution directorygit
